# AR_Cardboard
Google cardboard using the nexus 5 camera to create a virtual world on top of the real world

### TODO  
##### To get the first part of this done we need to  
  * Open the camera
  * Be able to load content
  * Wrap that in functions
  * Build some google cardboard of our own  
  
##### Then once we are done that, we can do interesting stuff  
  * Voice recognition
  * Object tracking
  * Hand gestures
  * Head gestures  
  
Once all of that is done, we can do some sample apps
  * Iron man HUD
  * face tracking?
  * block out billboards with kappa faces
